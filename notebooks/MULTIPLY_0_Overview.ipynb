    "We hereby provide you with a working version of the MULTIPLY framework. The MULTIPLY framework is a new toolkit to extract information from remote sensing data. In this python notebook  you will be able to download al the required earth observation data (using the data-access component), and afterwards retrieve land surface parameters (using the Inference Engine Module) at  20m resolution using a combination of MODIS coarse resolution data (from the Coarse res Preprocessing module) together with high resolution Sentinel-2 observations (from the high res preprocessing module), together with prior information on the land surface (by the Prior Engine module). In the future it is foreseen that multiple Radiative transfer models can be used, specific to the user requirements, however at the moment the only one available (in the forward operator module) is the emulated version of the PROSAIL radiative transfer mode . This limits the retrieval of land surface parameters to a) leaf-traits (Chlorophyll, Carotonoids, Dry matter, Water Content),  b) Vegetation structural parameters (hotspot parameter, LAI, leaf structure), and c some auxiliary soil parameters (Bsoil/Psoil).\n"

    "In it’s most basic description, a radiative transfer model is a model  capable of (using a specific state-vector) as an input simulateing the different interactions of radiation (light) from source (sun/clouds/..) to sensor (satellite ), using a specific state-vector as an input.  Within the model the most important absorption/transmission and reflection processes by different objects (soil/leaf/atmosphere) is characterized. In this regard there exist many radiative transfer models exist, depending on the level and detail of which important processes are taken into account. In practice, highly complex radiative radiative transfer models usually have a high number of input parameters (to describe in detail the 3D structure of the land surface and the full land surface heterogeneity), while less complex models employ specific hypotheses (such as land surface homogeneity) to require less input parameters. \n",

    "While this produces a large variety in radiative transfer models, all of these models have at least one common aspect: they can only be run in ‘forward mode’. This is because completely different scenarios can produce similar remote sensing observations. For example, when a land surface has a very low fractional vegetation cover (~0), different chlorophyll levels will produce similar remote sensing observations."

    "### 2.1.2\tData assimilation\n",
    "The most common way to circumvent the shortcoming of radiative transfer models is to ‘guess’ the initial state-vector, run the radiative transfer model using this initial assumption, and compare the output observation against the remote sensing measurement, producing an error. By guessing multiple times by constructing a Look-up-Table (LUT), multiple error-values can be calculated. The lowest error-value than represents our best understanding of the land surface (as long as our initial assumption was close enough to the real land surface description). Such an LUT approach has the large disadvantage that it only finds values that were used in the initial guessing; for example if for the Leaf Area Index (LAI) only values [0, 1, 2,.. ,6] were used, this retrieval method will not find the (actual) value of 1.22 m2/m2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization approaches can greatly circumvent the shortcomings of LUT approaches, as the initial scenarios can be updated on basis of the errors found. By  taking into account the sensitivity of the model to the state vector an iterative approach is in general ‘optimization’ of the radiative transfer model. However in this approach, it is possible for the state-vector to ‘slowly’ drift away into non-physical state-vectors (for example having LAI=0, but Chl = inf). In addition, the approach is limited to produce only results for when specific satellite measurements are being acquired. In order to solve these shortcomings additional (prior) information can be used within a data-assimilation framework. \n",

    "## 2.3\tPrior Information\n",
    "In such an data-assimilation approach, an additional error (Error value 2) different from the observational error (Error 1) is defined, describing the deviation of the state-vector from our initial assumption. Here the observational error is defined in units of the observation (e.q. reflectances [-] or radiances [W sr^(-1) m^(-2) nm^(-1)]), while the prior-error is defined in units of the state vector (LAI  [m^2  m^(-2)], Leaf Angle Distribition [deg], …). In order to reconcile these two into one cost function the errors are normalized. For the observational error this is performed by considering the observational errors, while for the prior information this is accomplished by considering the prior uncertainty (for example the standard deviation of long-term measurements of the respective land surface parameter). This leads then to one single cost-function defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "J_tot=(Error_1)/σ_1 +  (Error_2)/σ_2 =J_obs+J_prior\n",
    "\n",
    "This also immediately provides us with a method on synergistically combining different types of observations, as the observational error can simply be expanded to include multiple observations\n",
    "\n",
    "J_obs=J_obs^1+ J_obs^2+ J_obs^3+⋯\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, each of the error-terms corresponds to different pieces of information added to the system. In this case, even more additional information can also be introduced to the system, be considering the temporal evolution and spatial variation of specific land surface parameters. "
